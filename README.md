# 📂 Python File Organizer

This is a simple Python script that organizes files within a specified directory by moving them into subfolders based on their extension (e.g., Images, Videos, Documents).

## ✨ Features

* **Classification:** Categorizes files by type (images, videos, documents, archives, etc.).
* **Automatic Folder Creation:** Creates necessary subfolders automatically if they do not exist.
* **Simple Usage:** Easy to run from any terminal or command prompt.

## ⚙️ How to Use

### 1. Requirements

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) must be installed on your system.

### 2. Get the Code (Cloning the Repository)

Open your Terminal, Command Prompt, or Termux, and run the following commands to download the project:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/0pooj/file_organizer.py.git](https://github.com/0pooj/file_organizer.py.git)
cd file_organizer.py

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/0pooj/file_organizer.py.git](https://github.com/0pooj/file_organizer.py.git)
cd file_organizer.py
3.  Run the script using the command:

    ```bash
    python file_organizer.py
    ```

    **Note:** By default, the script organizes files in the same directory where it is run. If you want to organize a different folder, you may need to edit the `TARGET_DIR` variable inside the script.
